# Heart-Prediction_31
For this project, I used a publicly available dataset focused on heart disease prediction. It included both clinical and biometric details for several hundred patients—things like age, resting 9 heart rate, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and whether or not they ended up having heart disease. The dataset had a nice mix of numerical, categorical, and binary variables, which made it a
good fit for testing a range of machine learning models. It also had a final label—either 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease)—which turned this into a classic binary classification task. That said, like most real-world healthcare datasets, it wasn’t perfect. There were some missing values and a bit of imbalance in the target variable. I handled all that in the preprocessing step.

Here’s what I wanted this project to achieve:

● Use various machine learning models to predict the risk of heart disease.

● Evaluate how these models perform using metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision.

● Compare simpler models (like Random Forest) with more complex ones (like TabTransformer).

● Apply SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions and understand which features
are most influential.

● Reflect on the trade-off between accuracy and interpretability in healthcare use cases.
